## Step-by-step tutorial to running fastqc on HPC

### Part 1: Login & transfer files to HPC

*Super awesome useful link* [http://hpc.sabanciuniv.edu/](http://hpc.sabanciuniv.edu/) Contains useful information on how to get started with HPC. Highly recommend going through it! The information here is a subset of that contained in this guide.

1. Log in to HPC: For mac & linux, open terminal and write this: `ssh username@10.39.60.250`. If the username is correct, you'll be asked to enter your password. Both the username and password should also be in the SABANCI HPC Cluster User Information email sent to you by someone from Compecta.

2. Copy files from your computer to HPC
